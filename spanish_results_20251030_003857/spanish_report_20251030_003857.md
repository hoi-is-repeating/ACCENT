# ACCENT Spanish ASR Experiment Report

**Date**: 20251030_003857  
**Language**: Spanish  
**Pairs Tested**: 30

## Executive Summary

The ASR system shows a **LOANWORD** preference with an effect size of **0.55**.

## Results

### Overall Statistics
- Mean Loanword WER: 0.082
- Mean Native WER: 0.095  
- WER Difference: -0.013
- Effect Size (Cohen's d): 0.55

### Interpretation

The negative WER difference indicates that the ASR system recognizes loanwords more accurately than native Spanish equivalents. 
This suggests a systematic bias favoring international/English-origin terms, consistent with the hypothesis that multilingual 
ASR training creates lexical priors for common loanwords.


### Domain Analysis
- **Tech**: 0.010 favoring loanwords
- **Business**: 0.060 favoring loanwords
- **General**: 0.011 favoring loanwords


## Methodology

1. **Data**: Spanish loanword-native pairs from ConLoan dataset
2. **TTS**: Google Text-to-Speech with Spanish voice
3. **Validation**: SPECTRAL framework confirming pronunciation differentiation
4. **ASR**: Whisper model with Spanish language setting
5. **Metric**: Word Error Rate (WER) using Levenshtein distance

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates that ASR systems can exhibit systematic preferences between loanwords 
and native equivalents, with implications for:
- Fair representation of linguistic diversity
- Language preservation efforts
- Multilingual ASR development practices
