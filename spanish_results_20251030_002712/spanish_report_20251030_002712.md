# ACCENT Spanish ASR Experiment Report

**Date**: 20251030_002712  
**Language**: Spanish  
**Pairs Tested**: 29

## Executive Summary

The ASR system shows a **NATIVE** preference with an effect size of **0.00**.

## Results

### Overall Statistics
- Mean Loanword WER: 1.000
- Mean Native WER: 1.000  
- WER Difference: 0.000
- Effect Size (Cohen's d): 0.00

### Interpretation

The positive WER difference indicates that the ASR system recognizes native Spanish terms more accurately than loanwords.
This suggests that language-specific training may override any bias toward international terms.


### Domain Analysis
- **Entertainment**: 0.000 favoring native terms
- **Daily**: 0.000 favoring native terms
- **Business**: 0.000 favoring native terms
- **Sports**: 0.000 favoring native terms
- **Food**: 0.000 favoring native terms
- **Tech**: 0.000 favoring native terms


## Methodology

1. **Data**: Spanish loanword-native pairs from ConLoan dataset
2. **TTS**: Google Text-to-Speech with Spanish voice
3. **Validation**: SPECTRAL framework confirming pronunciation differentiation
4. **ASR**: Whisper model with Spanish language setting
5. **Metric**: Word Error Rate (WER) using Levenshtein distance

## Conclusion

This experiment demonstrates that ASR systems can exhibit systematic preferences between loanwords 
and native equivalents, with implications for:
- Fair representation of linguistic diversity
- Language preservation efforts
- Multilingual ASR development practices
